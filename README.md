# NAME OF THE GAME
  SNAKE

# SUMMARY OF THE GAME
  SNAKE is a classic video game that orignated during the late 1970s. 
  In this project, we have implemented the classic arcade game using
  PHP, JS, HTML/CSS and SQL. 
  
  The concept of the game is simple. The snake/player maneuvers a line 
  which grows in length, with the line itself as well as the boundary of
  the game being the primary obstacles. The goal of the game is to earn
  the highest score possible by consuming the 'food'.

# INSTRUCTIONS
  1. Create an account (Sign-up) or log-in to access the snake game.
  2. Use arrow keys or W/A/S/D to control the movement of the snake and PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN keys to adjust speed.
  3. Consume food to grow in size.
  4. Avoid hitting the boundary or the snake itself.
  5. Try to get the highest score.
  6. Enjoy! Don't forget to logout after you are done.
